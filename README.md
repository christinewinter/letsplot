# Creative Coding Stockholm meetup

Code for the Processing sketch we used during the Let's Plot meetup, from the [Creative Coding Stockholm meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Creative-Coding-Stockholm/).
The sketch creates a visual representation for the numbers from 0 to 256, 
based on their binary representations.
